# Scripts to scan for Microsoft Exchange Vulnerabilities

In 2021 several dangerous and widely exploited vulnerabilities for
Microsoft Exchange servers have been published. This repository
provides scripts to scan for

- [CVE-2021-26855](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26855):
  The SSRF vulnerability which is the entry point for the
  [ProxyLogon](https://proxylogon.com/) exploit chain.
- [CVE-2021-34473](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34473):
  The pre-auth path confusion which is the entry point for the
  [ProxyShell](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2021/8/17/from-pwn2own-2021-a-new-attack-surface-on-microsoft-exchange-proxyshell)
  exploit chain.

## CVE-2021-26855

For this vulnerability we use the same logic as [Microsoft's official
`nmap` script](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/blob/main/Security/src/http-vuln-cve2021-26855.nse),
but in a Python3 implementation.

## CVE-2021-34473

This script was inspired by [Kevin Beaumont's `nmap` script](https://github.com/GossiTheDog/scanning/blob/main/http-vuln-exchange-proxyshell.nse),
but again, we re-implemented it in Python3. This is basically a `GET`
request to a certain URL which classifies servers as vulnerable if
they respond with an HTTP status code `302 Found` and as patched
in case `400 Bad Request` is returned. However, we found several
Exchange servers which responded with other codes (mainly `401
Unauthorized`), so we added code to determine the version of 
the Exchange server in two ways:
1. Trying to parse it from the `X-OWA-Version` header in
  requests to `/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml` as described
  [here](https://www.msxfaq.de/exchange/update/exchange_build_nummer_ermitteln.htm#analyse_per_autod)
2. As the `X-OWA-Version` header is only present since the July 2021
  updates, so as a backup strategy for older servers, the script
  requests `/owa/` and tries to parse the version from the returned
  HTML. This was inpired by the `get_exchange_version` function in
  https://github.com/cert-lv/CVE-2020-0688/blob/master/lib.py

## Usage example

The main script to run is `scan.py`:
```
$ python3 scan.py --help
usage: scan.py [-h] [--method METHOD] [--timeout TIMEOUT] [--scheme {https://,http://}] [--path PATH] [--threads THREADS] [--patched PATCHED]
               [--unknown UNKNOWN] [--debug]
               {cve-2021-26855,cve-2021-34473} hostlist results

positional arguments:
  {cve-2021-26855,cve-2021-34473}
                        The CVE number to scan for.
  hostlist              List of IPs/hostnames to scan. One IP/hostname per line
  results               CSV file to write vulnerable hosts to. Format: "ip","timestamp","exchange_version_number",exchange_version_name"

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --method METHOD       The HTTP method to use. Default: "GET"
  --timeout TIMEOUT     The timeout to use for requests in seconds. Default: 2
  --scheme {https://,http://}
                        Scheme of the request, i.e. "http://" or "https://".
  --path PATH           The path on the webserver.
  --threads THREADS     Max number of parallel requests. Default: 300
  --patched PATCHED     File to write patched hosts to.
  --unknown UNKNOWN     File to write hosts to whose status is not known (e.g. not an Exchange, OWA not active).
  --debug               Print debug information.
```
An example run to scan all hosts in `hosts.txt` for CVE-2021-34473
with default method, timeout, and number of threads:
```
$ python3 scan.py --path '/autodiscover/autodiscover.json?@test.com/owa/?&Email=autodiscover/autodiscover.json%3F@test.com' \
                  --scheme 'https://' \
                  --patched $(date -Id)-patched.txt \
                  --unknown $(date -Id)-unknown.txt \
                  CVE-2021-34473 exchange-ips-at.txt $(date -Id)-vulnerable.txt
```
